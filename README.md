# Django-test-website
This is a BLOG page with a sign up mechanism.
This web application covers the idea of making a simple web application, its main feature is that it uses AJAX, Jquery to check if an email is already registered in the database with the help of Djang. This whole web application is made in Django, HTML and CSS.
The HTML and CSS templates are downloaded and edited, modified to fit the needs of the web application.
What you will learn out of this web application is that how you should use AJAX and Jquery in Django, Handling static files in a Django Project, The basic functioning of a Django web application.
I would suggest you read all the python files in the home folder and try to connect it to the html pages and understanding how these functions work.
